    <h2>Our History</h2>
    <section class="History">
      <div class="past">
      <p class="histext">
        <br />Wingstop was founded in 1994 in Garland, Texas, by Antonio Swad
        and his partner, who wanted to create a restaurant that specialized in
        chicken wings. The first location was a small takeout joint that quickly
        gained popularity for its flavorful wings and unique sauces. In 1997,
        the first franchised location opened in California, marking the
        beginning of Wingstop's expansion beyond Texas. By 2002, the brand had
        served its one billionth wing, solidifying its status as a leader in the
        chicken wing industry. Today, Wingstop has over 1,500 locations
        worldwide and continues to innovate with new flavors and menu items.
        <br />Wingstop's success can be attributed to its commitment to quality
        ingredients, made-to-order wings, and a focus on customer experience.
        The brand has also embraced technology, offering online ordering and
        delivery options to meet the demands of modern consumers. With a strong
        presence in both the United States and international markets, Wingstop
        remains dedicated to its mission of serving the world flavor, one wing
        at a time.
