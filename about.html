        <p class="b1">
          Willy's Wings was founded in 1994 by a group of friends who shared a
          passion for great food and good times. The first restaurant opened in
          Dallas, Texas, and quickly became a local favorite. The founders
          wanted to create a place where people could come together to enjoy
          delicious wings, flavorful sauces, and a fun atmosphere. Over the
          years, Willy's Wings has expanded to locations across the country, but
          the original spirit of the brand remains the same: to serve up
          mouthwatering wings and create unforgettable memories.

          Willy's Wings is not just about the food; it's about the experience.
          The founders believed that great food should be enjoyed in a fun and
          lively environment. That's why each Willy's Wings location is designed
          to be a place where friends and family can gather, relax, and enjoy
          each other's company. From the vibrant decor to the friendly staff,
          every aspect of Willy's Wings is designed to create a welcoming and
          enjoyable dining experience.
